# Supplementary Material for Modality Transfer.
A repository for the paper 'Modality Transfer in Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Deep Learning'.
Together with the trained model, a simple tool is also available to help you take a quick look at the results without a single line of coding. 

The tool only works with grayscale images of size 256x256 with the name format following the example images ("te_tr_{rest of the filename}.{extension}"). The model should be in the same folder as the application.
